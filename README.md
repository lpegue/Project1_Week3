I would like to code an educational game that requires the players to name the states of the U.S.  The home page will have an outline of the U.S. without the states' outlines.  As the player types in each state, it will appear on the  map.  The game will be timed so that each player only has a certain amount of time to list as many states as they can. Points can also be earned if the player types in the capital.  

This is a game for all ages.  Because the map will start without the state boundaries, it will be more difficult.
