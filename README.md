I would like to code an educational game that requires the players to name the states of the U.S.  The home page will have an outline of the U.S. without the states' outlines.  As the player types in each state, it will appear on the  map.  The game will be timed so that each player only has a certain amount of time to list as many states as they can. Points can also be earned if the player types in the capital.  

This is a game for all ages.  Because the map will start without the state boundaries, it will be more difficult.

There will be a map of U.S. with only the outside boundaries.  Under the map will be an input box to type the state's 2 initial abbreviation.  The page will display a timer and a score.

1.   Find a map of the U.S. without state boundaries to start.
2.	have a text box under the map that takes the 2 letter state abbrev.
3.	Once the abbreviation is entered, the state boundaries will appear and the counter will go up by 1.
4.  Include a timer.
5.  Include a reset button
